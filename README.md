# Magic-8-Ball
This is a simple Magic 8 Ball with 20 possible responses. 

# Description
Me and a fellow beginner wanted to see if we could quickly build a nice looking magic 8 ball program from scratch. This is mine. Basically you just input a question, and then 
press ENTER. The program returns one of 20 possible answers in the top middle of the screen. It is completely random. 


# Usage
Currently made for desktop only. To use, just drag index.html file to your browser tab. It is a one file program less than 150 total lines of code.

# Future
The first update will probably be sound and movement of the 8 ball upon pressing ENTER.
